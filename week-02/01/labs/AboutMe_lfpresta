    <p>I am a Junior at Syracuse University and I am studying Sport Management with minors in Information Management and Technology and Spanish. I am from South Salem, NY and went to John Jay High School before attending boarding school at The Gunnery. I play on the Division 1 Men's Ice Hockey Club as a Center here at Syracuse University.</p>
    <p>Growing up, I played baseball, ice hockey, and rowed when I attended the Gunnery. I enjoy hiking, traveling to new places, and listening to music. My favorite place to go is Brigantine Beach in New Jersey. I plan to work in the Sport Industry within the Corporate Partnerships department or as a sports agent or advisor. </p>
