For my project idea, I will create a website detailing the exclusive Spiderman comic series created by Todd McFarlane. I own all 16 McFarlane Spiderman comics so I can provide the images and describe the content in my own words. I have been a fan of McFarlaneÕs style and want to convey his work with Spiderman in an informative and interactive way.

Page 2: Before and After Spiderman #1
Page 3: Other McFarlane works

The covers will link to a page on that specific comic, with a short summary and details about McFarlaneÕs style.
