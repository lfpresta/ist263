<h1>About My Idea </h1>

<p>For my project idea, I will create a website detailing the exclusive Spiderman comic series created by Todd McFarlane. I own all 16 McFarlane Spiderman comics so I can provide the images and describe the content in my own words. I have been a fan of McFarlane’s style and want to convey his work with Spiderman in an informative and interactive way.</p>
