                        </div>
                    <p>Spider-Man is a web-crawling crime fighter who has fought countless villains in his effdorts to save the innocent citizens of New York City. Created in 1962 by Stan Lee and Steven Ditko, Spider-Man first appeared in <em>Amazing Fantasy #15</em> during the Silver Age of Comic Books and was well-received among the general public, sparking his own line of comics titled <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em>. <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em> was the longest running series of Spider-Man comics under Marvel and featured some of the most noteable scenes and villains in Spider-Man's career. Spider-Man has been featured in other series under Marvel including <em>The Spectacular Spider-Man, Web of Spider-Man</em> and much more.</p>
                    <p>The mask of Spider-Man hides the identity of Peter Parker, a teenager living in New York City who was bitten by a radioactive spider. The bite gives Peter superhuman abilities, including increased strength, the ability to climb walls and buildings, and the ability to shoot webs. Peter uses these new powers combined with his wit to fight crime and any threats against him, his family and friends, and the people of New York City. Throughout his battles in the comics, storylines arise that challenge Peter to make decisions that affect the fate of others, sometimes presenting a problem much greater than battling any villain that stands in his way.</p>

                    <h2>About Todd McFarlane</h2>
                    <p>Todd McFarlane is the creator of <em>Torment</em> series and has a history of working with Spider-Man comics, particularly with <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em> series. His rise to fame came from working with Marvel Comics on <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em> franchise, as McFarlane was the first artist to draw arguably Spider-Man's greatest foe in Venom. McFarlane is known for his attention to detail with scenery, the Spider-Man character and the aerial web-swinging and "spaghetti webbing". </p>
                    <p>McFarlane's decision to start his own Spider-Man series -- simply titled <em>Spider-Man</em> -- was unprecedented given his prior experience creating art for <em>Amazing Spider-Man #298 - #328</em>. After being dissatisfied with the inability to control the storylines of the series, McFarlane broke off and wrote the new Spider-Man collection under Marvel Comics in 1990. McFarlane's Spider-Man collection began with the five-part "Torment" story arch, continuing with 11 more issues (although McFarlane only did covers for 15 comics total) until <em>Spider-Man #16</em>. The series received praise for its artistic elements but many questioned McFarlane's storytelling ability. The typically light-hearted nature of the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man was flipped upside down as McFarlane explored graphic and violent depictions of the hero's adventures and battles. </p>

                    <h2>The Torment Series</h2>
                    <p>"Torment" is the beginning of McFarlane's individual Spider-Man project. With the release of <em>Spider-Man #1</em> in August 1990, about 2.5 million copies were sold due in large part to the variant covers released by Marvel to encourage people to collect all three covers. Although the series was another display of McFarlane's distinct style, "Torment" was the first example of McFarlane's storyline with Spider-Man where he had close-to full control over the comic. McFarlane decided to feature Spider-Man and infamous foe "The Lizard" for his opening story arch, with a few twists sprinkled throughout the series. The five-part series set the stage for a unique collection of storylines that included vivid frames, crossover of other Marvel characters, and a daring expansion of the character of Spider-Man.</p>
