                        <p>Spiderman #1 begins with a classic introduction to the hero, as Spiderman saves another person from danger. Peter Parker returns to comfort his wife, Mary Jane, as she often worries about him and the risks he takes as Spiderman. Meanwhile, darkness looms as a familiar foe of Spiderman, the Lizard, lurks in the shadows of the night in New York City. The Lizard hunts down and kills 3 victims by clashing them to death, which gets the attention of our Friendly, Neighborhood Spiderman.</p>

                    <p>As the first comic in the series kicks off "Torment," Spider-Man is shown in a way never seen before. Physically, Spider-Man is portrayed as the ultimate super-hero with big muscles, new and improved webbing, and larger eyes to intimidate any foes that he encounters. Combining that with the classic red and blue look, Spider-Man has a fresh, revamped look that followers of McFarlane's style go crazy for.
